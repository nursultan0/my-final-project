# Web-based-Spring-and-Hibernate-application-Using-a-MySQL-database

Just me having fun with spring mvc and hibernate with some front end stuff :D  
I am using Spring with a MySQL database which uses Hibernate to gestionate the submitted forms 

  To start you need to create a database with the name mydata and 
  Also put in the password and the username in the application.properties file  
  I used codepen.io to get some of the designs so give credit to the creators.
